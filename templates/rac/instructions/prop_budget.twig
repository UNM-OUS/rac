{# <p>
    This page includes itemized budget and budget justification. The budget justification must include a brief description of why each component of the itemized budget is essential to the project. The justification must also state why any other current funding/support listed in current and pending cannot be used instead of the requested RAC funds. Budget should be well justified and provide appropriate sources for cost. Separate quotes for example - Invoices, or quotes, or informal product pages, vendor email correspondences of items or services that exceed $1000 should be provided. (Separate quotes will not count toward page limit.)
