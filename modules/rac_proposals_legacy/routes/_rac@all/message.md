Dear Dr. [submitter_lname],

A Research Allocations Committee proposal you submitted in [call_semester] [call_year] has been migrated to a new system, and some new URLs and features are now available to you.

The proposal "[proposal_title]" now has a permanent page assigned to it at the following URL:  
[[url_proposal]]([url_proposal])

To view the proposal page you will need to sign in with the NetID you originally used to submit the proposal.

If the proposal was funded, the proposal page will also contain a link to submit a final report if you have not already done so. You will be able to use the above link to view/download your proposal and its associated ratings and funding decisions for the foreseeable future.
